// Here, JavaScript interprets the line break as an “implicit” semicolon. This is called an automatic semicolon insertion.

// In most cases, a newline implies a semicolon. But “in most cases” does not mean “always”!

// There are cases when a newline does not mean a semicolon. For example:
// We recommend putting semicolons between statements even if they are separated by newlines. 
// This rule is widely adopted by the community. Let’s note once again – it is possible to leave out semicolons most of the time.
//  But it’s safer – especially for a beginner – to use them.

// console.log(3 +
// 1
// + 2)

// ! here js ensures that at end of line semicolon will require

//console.log("hi")
const alert =alert("hi")
[1,2].forEach(alert)
